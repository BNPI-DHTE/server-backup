# Python archiver for field data projects

This archiver application designed for BÃ¼kk National Park Directorate field data collector
system. It can archive the collected data and other important files, for example
QField/QGIS project files.

The application can create an archive from files filtered by list of extensions in a given
folder and its subfolders. In a json file, you can add some options to the application.
The name of the json file can be added as a command-line argument. The configuration file
detailed below.

To run the application, move to the application folder, enter the
`python3 backup.py settings.json` or `python3 backup.py settings.json`command in terminal.
In this case, the settings.json file will be in the application's folder.

## Configuration file

You have to create a .json file to define configurations. You can add multiple options as
json list items to the json file. For example:

    [
      {
        "backup_type": "data"
        "root_folder": "/home/data/fieldwork"
        "data_folder": "field/databases/"
        "backup_folder": "backup/"
        "extension": [
          "gpkg",
          "gokg-wal",
          "gpkg-shm"
        ],
        "archive_type": "gz"
      },
      {
        "backup_type": "project",
        "root_folder": "/home/data/fieldwork",
        "data_folder": "field/projectfiles/",
        "backup_folder": "backup/",
        "extensions": [
          "qgs",
          "qgz",
          "zip",
          "db"
        ],
        "archive_type": "bz2"
      }
    ]

Using the configuration file above, the application will work in the
`/home/data/fieldwork` folder. The first section will save the geopackage files being
inside the `/home/data/fieldwork/field/databases` folder recursively into the
`/home/data/fieldwork/backup/data` folder as a tar.gz file. The archive file's name will
be `data_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_MM_ss.tar.gz`, where `yyyy_mm_dd_hh_MM_ss` is the archiving date
and time.  

The second section will save recursively all the QGIS projects and related files being
inside the `/home/data/fieldwork/field/projectfiles/` into a
`project_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_MM_ss.tar.bz2` file, which will be inside the
`/home/data/fieldwork/backup/project` folder.

### Backup type
Necessary.  
No default value.  
Type of the files you want to back up (data, project files, etc.) Will create a subfolder
with the backup type name inside backup folder. The name of the file will also contain
the type of backup.

### Root folder
Necessary.  
No default value.  
The root folder of the project. The root folder must contain the 
data and the backup folder.

### Data folder
Necessary.  
No default value.  
The data folder relative to the root folder, you want to back up. This contains the files
to save.

### Backup folder
Necessary.  
No default value.  
The folder where you will save archives. Relative path to the root folder.

### Extension
Optional.  
Default value: `"*"`
You can add list of extensions, the application will filter and archive only these files.
Don't need to add punctuation marks before extensions.

### Archive type
Optional.  
Default value: `"bz2"`
This option will set the archive format.
There are three values you can use in this field: gz (gzip compression), xz (lzma
compression), bz2 (bzip2 compression).
